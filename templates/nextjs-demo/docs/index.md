# NextJs Template - Build a static site demo with GH Page

**Create a demo of a fully static NextJs project**

This template demonstrates how to create a simple static website using Next.js in static export mode, and deploy it to GitHub Pages.

In this template, you will be guided through:

- Naming your project
- Authenticating with GitHub to create the repository
- Running a dry-run with process logs

**Important notes:**

- Your authentication data is used only for the project creation process. An OAuth access token with a limited lifetime is generated and not reused.
- The final project is not automatically registered in the main catalog; the process stops after creating the repository in your GitHub account.

Use this template as a starting point for building and deploying static Next.js sites to GitHub Pages.
